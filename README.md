# edl
This repo contains a how-to guide and some example files for an automated External Dynamic List (EDL) solution, built to enable rapid, hands-off blocking of malicious IPs in a firewall. The setup leverages Azure Storage, Azure Functions, and SentinelOne integration to maintain a cloud-hosted, dynamically updated EDL.
